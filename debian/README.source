Debian packaging notes for ooniprobe
====================================

This package uses quilt.

This package is in contrib as currently it is not possible to build the web
assets using Debian main. nodejs-gulp and nodejs-webpack are required
dependencies and so for now, those will ship pre-built with the original
sources found in debian/ooni-wui.
