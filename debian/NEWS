ooniprobe (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting from ooniprobe 2.0.0, there is now a new agent daemon
  (ooniprobe-agent) that is responsible for performing the regular measurements
  and updating ooniprobe's resources in place of the old cron jobs. The cron
  jobs will be removed as part of this upgrade along with the now defunct
  /etc/default/ooniprobe file that stored the cronjob settings.
 
  If you had previously chosen to run measurements daily, these will no longer
  be run and you must now visit the ooniprobe-agent web frontend to configure
  running daily measurements. This is also necessary to provide informed consent
  for the measurements to be run.
 
  You'll find the web frontend at:
 
    http://127.0.0.1:8842/

  You can also configure ooniprobe from the command-line by running:

    sudo -u Debian-ooni ooniprobe --initialize
 
  If you do not configure ooniprobe via the web interface or command line, no
  measurements will be run.
